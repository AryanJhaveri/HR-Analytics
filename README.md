# HR Analytics Using SQL and PowerBI

## Project Overview

This project takes a deep dive into HR data, using SQL for data cleaning and manipulation, followed by PowerBI for insightful visualization and analysis. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- SQL Server or any SQL environment for executing SQL scripts.
- PowerBI Desktop for interacting with the dashboards.
- Download the `HR Data.csv` from this repository for your raw data source.

### Installation

1. **Database Setup and Data Import**

   Begin by setting up your database using the SQL scripts provided in the repository. Refer to `table_creation.sql` for the schema creation.

   Once your database is ready, import the `HR Data.csv` to populate your newly created tables. 

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

   With your data imported, move on to cleaning and preparing the dataset using the SQL scripts found in `sql_queries.sql`. These scripts will help standardize your data, making it ready for analysis.

3. **Analysis and Visualization**

   Open PowerBI and connect to your SQL database. Import the prepared data and utilize the provided PowerBI dashboard file (`HR_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix`) to explore the visualized insights.

## Exploring the Dashboards

The PowerBI dashboards are designed to provide interactive and intuitive insights into the HR data. Key features include:

- Employee demographics analysis.
- Turnover rates across different departments.
- Job title and role change analysis over time.

These dashboards offer a dynamic way to explore the data, uncover hidden patterns, and make informed decisions.
